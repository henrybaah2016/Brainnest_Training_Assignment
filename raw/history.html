        Before the Rawlings administration, tourism in Ghana was not an effective source of income for
         the Ghanaian society and was thus a missed opportunity in helping to diversify the Ghanaian economy. 
         The Rawlings administration saw this area of opportunity and capitalized on it, ultimately 
         appropriating the Ghanaian culture and utilizing it as a source of revenue. 
         Through the restoration of castles that were once used for the slave industry, 
         establishment of public memorials honouring the "illustrious sons" of Ghana coupled with
        encouragement from the government via incentives for private investments, the Rawlings 
          administration was effectively able to push tourism forward with the cost of capitalizing 
          on Ghanaian culture. The tourist industry in Ghana is known to promote sustainable tourism
           that includes: cultural tourism, heritage tourism, recreational tourism, adventure tourism 
           and events tourism. Cultural tourism focuses on festivals and events, whereas heritage tourism 
           focuses on the history of the slave routes. Recreational tourism allows tourists to explore 
           beaches and theme parks. Adventure tourism takes a look at rain forests and game parks,
            and event tourism focuses on resources and conferences.Many of the heritage tourism sites 
            highlight the legacy of the African Diaspora and the social composition of communities. 
            As a result, these studies have impacted the tourists' connection to the heritage tourism
            sites by providing cultural depth to their travelling experience.

        In Ghana, various methods of transportation are used by tourists. Some of them may be safer 
        than others but are not always available. Here we will explain methods of transportation that 
        are unique to Ghana and other developing countries:The Tro Tro is one method of transportation 
        that usually utilizes a minivan and are used to travel anywhere throughout Ghana. Though an 
        uncomfortable mode of transportation due to it being usually packed with passengers, 
        it is still a viable option and the cost is fairly low. In Ghana, there are also "hurry cars"; 
        these are private cars that have set destinations and wait for passengers that are going to the 
        set destination of the hurry car. They are typically found by transport stations and is 
        definitely a more comfortable method of travel as opposed to a Tro Tro. The drivers of 
        hurry cars will usually hold signs or give some type of information letting passengers know 
        the destination they are set to go.
